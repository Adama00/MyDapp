Wallet Asset Converter is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to convert their Ethereum (ETH) holdings to Bitcoin (BTC) and vice versa. The dApp is built using Web3.js and Chainlink, with a user-friendly frontend created using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
Features

    Convert ETH to BTC: The dApp fetches the balance of ETH in a user's wallet and converts it to its equivalent value in BTC using real-time price data from Chainlink.
    Convert BTC to ETH: The dApp fetches the balance of BTC (calculated from ETH) and converts it back to its equivalent value in ETH.
    Real-Time Data: It uses Chainlink's decentralized oracles to fetch up-to-date price feeds for ETH and BTC.
    User Input: Users can enter their wallet address to fetch and convert their assets.
    Responsive UI: The application is designed with a lavender-purple-pink theme using Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and responsive user interface.
